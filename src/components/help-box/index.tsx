3. As a Researcher, I want to upload a CSV file containing text data so that I can process it using the NLP features of the application.

4. As a Researcher, I want to use NLP to find topics and themes in the uploaded text data so that I can analyze and organize the information.

5. As a Researcher, I want to organize the identified themes into groups so that they can be presented in a meaningful way.

6. As an Editor, I want to review and modify the groups created by the Researcher so that the final presentation is accurate and well-organized.

7. As a Viewer, I want to access the dashboard and view the graphs representing the grouped themes so that I can understand the analysis results.

8. As a Guest, I want to interact with the Organization's public-facing content so that I can gain insights from their analysis.`;
